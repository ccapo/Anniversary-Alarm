# ATtiny85 Anniversary Alarm
An ATtiny85 powered anniversary alarm, that will play one of three tones at the desired date and time.

This project is based on the work of Vishnu Aiea's [Birthday-Alarm](https://github.com/vishnumaiea/Birthday-Alarm), but heavily modified to deal with the ATtiny85's limitations (i.e. No Serial port, 8 KB program memory and 512 B RAM).

The hope is that this alarm will last for a similarly long time, but without measurements of the current consumption, I do not have an estimate for how long with will last on a single CR2450 coin cell battery.
